# Donkey Kong

The game is quite simple to figure out

Move Mario left and right on the girders, up and down the ladders and avoid any obstacles in the way (either by jumping over them).

At the top of the level is your arch enemy, Donkey Kong, as well as your dearly beloved Pauline. Between you and Pauline lies a large concoction of girders and ladders. To make matters worse, Donkey Kong has bounced up and down on the girders, causing them to bend downwards, so he can throw barrels down the girders to prevent you from reaching him.

Overcome obstacles and reach paulin
